    # Always try to copy the files to the bin directory after every build and deliberatly ignore
    # copy errors, usually the error is because a running process has locked the file.
    #
    # It is useful to copy every time because the copy may have failed last time due to the file
    # being in use, and we'll usually want to try again (after killing the process).
    #
    # Yes, this looks like a ridiculous thing to do, but it really is necessary to
    # use a Python script to copy files on Windows. Why? Two reasons:
    #
    #   1. Windows file locks (on running processes) creates a very painful development
    #      experience; you can't overwrite the binary you're running it.
    #      Why not just stop the process? Windows services are an abject PITA to manage,
    #      and we don't always care about overwriting all binaries.
    #
    #   2. The Windows copy command is limited and gives vague/misleading errors.
    #      The CMake copy command also has similar shortfalls.
    #
    # Patches welcome! :)
